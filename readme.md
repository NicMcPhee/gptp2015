# MS Prep for Genetic Programming Theory & Practice 2015

## In brief

"Genetic programming as if you meant it: real and imaginary user experience"

My title is a direct nod to [Keith Braithwaite's](http://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/) exercise for software developers, "TDD as if you meant it". Like the original exercise, what I describe here for genetic programming may seem onerous and difficult to most experienced theoreticians or practitioners. I'll make the case that this approach suggests---and demonstrates---a broader systematic framework in which genetic programming is far more likely to _provide value to its users_ than we find in a quarter-decade of exploration. Along the way, I'm forced to address deep philosophical problems in the program of genetic progamming research and practice more broadly: _viz._, what it is "for" and when it is "done".
