# MS Prep for Genetic Programming Theory & Practice 2015

## In brief

[A kind of abstract will go here...]

## Structure

- How can one "use" genetic programming?
- Cases for and against "usable GP": cost, features, reliability, simplicity
- "Artificial Intelligence investigated by Special Crimes Unit"; or, Even Athena needed the head of Zeus
- The mangle of practice and the mangle in practice
- The yardstick and the bamboo hand
- Leveraging "resistance": the problem of the dots and lines
- "Batch" and "Interactive"
- Expressing "resistance": the problem of Bertrand's Paradox
- Exploration and exploitation interfaces and affordances
- The deeper question: What should it mean to _act intelligently_?
