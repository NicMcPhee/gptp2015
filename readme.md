# MS Prep for Genetic Programming Theory & Practice 2015

"Genetic programming as if you meant it: real and imaginary user experience"

My working title is a direct nod to [Keith Braithwaite's](http://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/) CodeRetreat/kata exercise "TDD as if you meant it". Like Keith's exercise, what I describe is both "advanced" and "difficult" from a subjective standpoint, at least insofar as this sort of _rigorous mindfulness_ is advanced and difficult.

The story lives smack dab at the intersection of theory and practice: I describe in detail a suite of practical algorithms that _include_ (as a special case) what we typically call "genetic programming", and explore the theoretical consequences of the framing narratives we use about our work.

## In brief

[A kind of abstract will go here...]

## Structure

- Pickering's "Mangle of Practice"
- The words you think you need
- What it can mean to "use" genetic programming
- Cases for and against "usable GP": cost, features, reliability, simplicity
- "Artificial Intelligence investigated by Special Crimes Unit"; or, Even Athena needed the head of Zeus
- The mangle of practice and the mangle in practice
- The yardstick and the bamboo hand
- Leveraging "resistance": the problem of the dots and lines
- "Batch" and "interactive" styles
- Expressing "resistance": the problem of Bertrand's Paradox
- Exploration and exploitation interfaces and affordances
- The deeper question: What should it mean to _act intelligently_?
