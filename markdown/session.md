# An example session

**Placeholder**: I am converting the transcript of the session from an awful multipage LaTeX `\longtable` into a much more manageable `\enum` list like this. It will take a while, since the original `\longtable` was more than nine pages long and full of table markup.

## The stage is set

`me`
: well what have we here?

`system`
: it does and says something back to me

`me`
: hey look I can have a little dialog sortof

`system`
: I can fight you every step of the way, though!

## Progress and Stagnation

`me`
: Keep going

`system`
: OK!

## Innovation

`me`
: Hey!

`system`
: What?

## Frustrations
